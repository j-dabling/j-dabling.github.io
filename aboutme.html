	<p style="color:#02f702; padding-top:0px; margin:0;">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
        <p>My name is Jacob Dabling, and I enjoy finding and solving problems! I've been building and programming computers for four years now. Programming for me became a way to change and explore the world around me since computers captured my interest. I've learned to especially love Linux systems for their openess and ease of customizability.</p>
	 About<p>I built this website mainly as a place to document any projects that I work on, as well as any tools/technologies that catch my attention. From PC to mobile, to networking, to project devlogs and takes on new tech, you can expect to find it here! Welcome!</p>
